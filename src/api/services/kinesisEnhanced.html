<p>
    Amazon Kinesis with Enhanced Fanout is one of the <strong>only event sources</strong> that integrates directly with AWS Lambda that
    provides strict ordering guaruntees. It does this in a scalable fashion via sharding and the usage of partition keys
    to gauruntee ordering of all related records on that partition key.

    The key difference between Amazon Kinesis and Amazon Kinesis with Enhanced Fanout is that the enhanced fanout streams allow you to create additional "replicated" streams so each consumer can get a dedicated pipe to consume with higher performance and the same ordering gauruntees. There is a soft limit of 5 subscribers via enhanced fanouts, which you can open a support ticket to get increased.
